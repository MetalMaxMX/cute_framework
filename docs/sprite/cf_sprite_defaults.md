# cf_sprite_defaults

Category: [sprite](/api_reference?id=sprite)  
GitHub: [cute_sprite.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_sprite.h)

Returns an empty sprite.

```cpp
CF_Sprite cf_sprite_defaults()
```

## Remarks

Empty sprites can not be drawn. You probably don't want this function unless you know what you're doing, instead,
you may be looking for [cf_make_sprite](/sprite/cf_make_sprite.md) or `cf_make_easy_sprite`.
