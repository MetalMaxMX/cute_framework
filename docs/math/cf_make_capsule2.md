# cf_make_capsule2

Category: [math](/api_reference?id=math)

Returns a capsule.

```cpp
CF_Capsule cf_make_capsule2(CF_V2 p, float height, float radius)
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
p | The position the capsule stands upon.
height | The total length of the capsule, from end to end.
radius | How thick the capsule is. Make sure this is less than or equal to height (or you'll get a sphere).

## Remarks

The `height` is measured from the end of each cap, covering the full length of the capsule. The capsule is constructed
standing straight up on the y-axis. You should make sure `height` is taller than the `radius`. `a` is the center of the
bottom cap, while `b` is the center of the top cap.
