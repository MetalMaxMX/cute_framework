Returns the 8-bit unsigned addition of two input 8-bit numbers, intended for implementing 8-bit color blend operations.

```cpp
uint8_t cf_add_un8(int a, int b)
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
a | An 8-bit value promoted to an `int` upon calling.
b | An 8-bit value promoted to an `int` upon calling.

## Remarks

This is a helper-function intended for advanced users.
The core calculation is done with full integers to help avoid intermediate overflows on 8-bit values.
