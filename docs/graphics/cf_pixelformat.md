## Remarks

Not all types are supported on each backend. Be sure to check with [cf_query_pixel_format](/graphics/cf_query_pixel_format.md) if a particular pixel format
is available for your use-case. If unsure, just use `CF_PIXELFORMAT_DEFAULT` for red-green-blue-alpha, 8 bits per component (32 bits total),
which get mapped to 4 floats on the GPU from [0,1].

This table helps understand how to read the pixel format notation.

Notation | Description
--- | ---
RGBA | R stands for red, G stands for green, B stands for blue, A stands for alpha.
XX | A number, describes the number of bits used by the pixel format. For example `CF_PIXELFORMAT_R8` uses 8 bits, while `PIXELFORMAT_RG16F` uses 16 bits.
N | A normalized number from [0,1]. All the bits of the format will be treated as an integer. For example, `CF_PIXELFORMAT_R8` starts as an 8-bit value on the CPU, but is mapped from [0,255] to [0,1] as a float on the GPU.
UI | The GPU will interpret the bits of a pixel as an unsigned integer.
SI | The GPU will interpret the bits of a pixel as a signed integer.
F | The GPU will interpret the bits of a pixel as a floating point value.
N | Stands for "normalized". The pixel's bits are mapped from [0,2^##] to floating point [0,1] on the GPU.
SN | Signed-normalized. The same as N, but mapped to floating point [-1,1] on the GPU.

The other formats such as BC (Block Compression for DirectX), PVRTC (for iOS), and ETC2 (OpenGL ES and ARM devices) are common compression formats.
These can potentially save a lot of memory on the GPU, but are only good for certain games (mainly 3D games), and are only available on certain backends.
