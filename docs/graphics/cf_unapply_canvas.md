# cf_unapply_canvas

Category: [graphics](/api_reference?id=graphics)  
GitHub: [cute_graphics.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_graphics.h)  
---

An optional function to end the current rendering pass.

```cpp
void cf_unapply_canvas();
```

## Remarks

This is only useful when a particular canvas needs to be destroyed, though it may be currently applied. For example, if the screen is
resized and you want to resize some of your canvases as well.
