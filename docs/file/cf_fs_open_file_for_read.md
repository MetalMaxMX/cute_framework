Opens a file for reading.

```cpp
CF_File* cf_fs_open_file_for_read(const char* virtual_path);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
virtual_path | The virtual path to the file.

## Return Value

Returns a [CF_File](/file/cf_file.md) pointer representing the file.

## Remarks

If you just want some basic information about the file (such as it's size or when it was created), you can use [cf_fs_stat](/file/cf_fs_stat.md) instead. [Virtual File System](https://randygaul.github.io/cute_framework/#/topics/virtual_file_system).
