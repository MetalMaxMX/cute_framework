# CF_ReadWriteLock

An opaque handle representing a read-write lock.

## Remarks

A read/write lock can have a large number of simultaneous readers, but only one writer at a time. This can be
used as an opimization where a resources can be safely read from many threads. Then, when the resource must be
modified a writer can wait for all readers to leave, and then exclusively lock to perform a write update.
