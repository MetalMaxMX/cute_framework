# cf_make_coroutine

Category: [coroutine](/api_reference?id=coroutine)  
GitHub: [cute_coroutine.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_coroutine.h)  
---

Sets up the entry point for a coroutine to start.

```cpp
CF_Coroutine cf_make_coroutine(CF_CoroutineFn* fn, int stack_size, void* udata);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
fn | The entry point (function) the coroutine runs.
stack_size | The size of the coroutine's stack to call functions and make local variables, the default is about 57344 bytes.
udata | Can be `NULL`. Gets handed back to you when [cf_coroutine_get_udata](/coroutine/cf_coroutine_get_udata.md) is called.

## Remarks

The coroutine starts in a `COROUTINE_STATE_SUSPENDED`, and won't run until [cf_coroutine_resume](/coroutine/cf_coroutine_resume.md) is first called. Free up the
coroutine with [cf_destroy_coroutine](/coroutine/cf_destroy_coroutine.md) when done. See [CF_Coroutine](/coroutine/cf_coroutine.md) for some more details. IMPORTANT NOTE: You should beef
up the stack_size to 1 or 2 MB (you may use e.g. `CF_MB  2`) if you wish to call into APIs such as DirectX. A variety of APIs
and libraries out there have very deep or complex call stacks -- so the default size may cause stack overflows in such cases.
