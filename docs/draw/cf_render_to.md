# cf_render_to

Category: [draw](/api_reference?id=draw)  
GitHub: [cute_draw.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_draw.h)  
---

Renders to a [CF_Canvas](/graphics/cf_canvas.md).

```cpp
void cf_render_to(CF_Canvas canvas, bool clear);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
canvas | The canvas to render to.
clear | True to clear the canvas's previous contents, false otherwise.

## Remarks

This is advanced function. It's useful for off-screen rendering for certain rendering effects, such as multi-pass
effects like reflections, or advanced lighting techniques. By default, everything will get renderered to the app's
canvas, so this function is not necessary to call at all. Instead, calling [cf_app_draw_onto_screen](/app/cf_app_draw_onto_screen.md) should be the go-to.
