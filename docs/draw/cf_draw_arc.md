Draws an arc of a circle wireframe.

```cpp
void cf_draw_arc(CF_V2 p, CF_V2 center_of_arc, float range, int iters, float thickness);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
p | Center of the arc.
center_of_arc | Radius of the circle.
range | Angle the arc covers.
iters | Number of edges used for the circle. More looks smoother, but renders slower.
thickness | The thickness of each line to draw.
