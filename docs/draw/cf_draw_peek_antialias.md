# cf_draw_peek_antialias

Category: [draw](/api_reference?id=draw)  
GitHub: [cute_draw.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_draw.h)  
---

Returns the last antialias state.

```cpp
bool cf_draw_peek_antialias();
```

## Remarks

Various shape drawing functions can be drawn in antialiased mode, or in plain mode. Antialiasing is slightly slower,
but looks much smoother.
