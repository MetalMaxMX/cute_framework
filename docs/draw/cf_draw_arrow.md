Draws an arrow.

```cpp
void cf_draw_arrow(CF_V2 a, CF_V2 b, float thickness, float arrow_width);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
a | The starting point.
b | The end point.
thickness | The thickness of the line to draw.
arrow_width | The width of the arrow to draw.

## Remarks

This function is intended only for debug purposes. It's implemented in naive way so the
arrow shaft will overdraw atop the arrow head. This will become visible if the arrow is
drawn with any transparency.
