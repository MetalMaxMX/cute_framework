# cf_draw_push_antialias_scale

Category: [draw](/api_reference?id=draw)  
GitHub: [cute_draw.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_draw.h)  
---

Returns the last antialias scale.

```cpp
void cf_draw_push_antialias_scale(float scale);
```

## Remarks

Antialias scale controls how much antialiasing will be used. A larger number makes the borders of shapes blurry.
The number must be greater than 0, but probably not more than 2 or 3 for most cases. The default is 1.5.
