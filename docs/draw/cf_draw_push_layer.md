Category: [draw](/api_reference?id=draw)

Pushes a draw layer.

```cpp
void cf_draw_push_layer(int layer);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
layer | The layer.

## Remarks

Draw layers are sorted before rendering. Lower numbers are rendered fast, while larger numbers are rendered last.
This can be used to pick which sprites/shapes should draw on top of each other.
