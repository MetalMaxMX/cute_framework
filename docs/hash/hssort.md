# hssort

Category: [hash](/api_reference?id=hash)  
GitHub: [cute_hashtable.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_hashtable.h)  
---

Sorts the {key, item} pairs in the table by keys, where the keys are treated as C-strings.

```cpp
#define hssort(h) cf_hashtable_ssort(h)
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
h | The hashtable. Can be `NULL`. Needs to be a pointer to the type of items in the table.

## Remarks

The keys and items returned by [hkeys](/hash/hkeys.md) and [hitems](/hash/hitems.md) will be sorted. Normally it's not valid to store strings as keys,
since all keys are simply typecasted to `uint64_t`. However, if you use [sintern](/string/sintern.md) each unique string has a unique and
stable pointer, making them valid keys for hashtables. This is _not_ a stable sort.
