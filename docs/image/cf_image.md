# CF_Image

Category: [image](/api_reference?id=image)  
GitHub: [cute_image.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_image.h)  
---

An array of pixels.

Struct Members | Description
--- | ---
`int w` | Width of the image in pixels.
`int h` | Height of the image in pixels.
`CF_Pixel* pix` | An array of pixels.

## Remarks

You probably do not need this. In Cute Framework loading images manually is not often
necessary, as most games can use CF's [Draw API](https://randygaul.github.io/cute_framework/#/topics/drawing) to get sprites onto the screen.
However, a good use case is, for example, if you want to implement some custom shader and feed it a texture.
