# cf_make_handle_allocator

Category: [utility](/api_reference?id=utility)  
GitHub: [cute_handle_table.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_handle_table.h)  
---

Returns a new [CF_HandleTable](/utility/cf_handletable.md).

```cpp
CF_HandleTable* cf_make_handle_allocator(int initial_capacity);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
initial_capacity | The initial number of handles to store within. Grows internally as necessary.

## Remarks

The handle table is used to generate [CF_Handle](/utility/cf_handle.md)s with [cf_handle_allocator_alloc](/utility/cf_handle_allocator_alloc.md). Each handle is unique and maps
to a 32-bit index along with a 16-bit type value. This is useful for adding a layer of indirection to systems that
want to track object lifetimes, grant access to objects, while also decoupling object memory storage from their
lifetime cycles. Free it up with [cf_destroy_handle_allocator](/utility/cf_destroy_handle_allocator.md) when done.
