# CF_World

Category: [ecs](/api_reference?id=ecs)

An opaque handle represent an ECS world.

## Remarks

All entities reside within a world. There's a default world, but you may also create your own
own worlds with [cf_make_world](/ecs/cf_make_world.md). To select a current world, use [cf_world_push](/ecs/cf_world_push.md). Whichever world
is currently selected will be referenced when calling any ECS-related function.
