# cf_entity_delayed_change_type

Category: [ecs](/api_reference?id=ecs)

Changes the type of this entity.

```cpp
void cf_entity_delayed_change_type(CF_Entity entity, const char* entity_type);
```

## Remarks

The change is delayed to the end of the frame. Since this function can clean up components
that disappear it may be beneficial to delay in order to avoid dangling references, or simplify
gameplay logic that depends on these components.

This function can be useful for implementing certain editors.
