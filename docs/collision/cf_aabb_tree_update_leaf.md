# cf_aabb_tree_update_leaf

Category: [collision](/api_reference?id=collision)

---

Update's a [CF_Leaf](/collision/cf_leaf.md)'s AABB (axis-aligned bounding box). Call this if your object moves to let the tree know about it.

```cpp
bool cf_aabb_tree_update_leaf(CF_AabbTree tree, CF_Leaf leaf, CF_Aabb aabb);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
tree | The tree.
leaf | The [CF_Leaf](/collision/cf_leaf.md) representing your object, returned from [cf_aabb_tree_insert](/collision/cf_aabb_tree_insert.md).
aabb | The new wrapping AABB around your moved object (you must re-calculate this AABB before calling).

## Return Value

Returns true if the leaf was updated internally, false otherwise.

## Remarks

Internally there are some optimizations so that the tree is only adjusted if the aabb is moved enough. See the return value for more details.
