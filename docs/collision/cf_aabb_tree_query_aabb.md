---

Finds all [CF_Leaf](/collision/cf_leaf.md)'s who's AABB overlaps the param `aabb`.

```cpp
void cf_aabb_tree_query_aabb(const CF_AabbTree tree, CF_AabbTreeQueryFn* fn, CF_Aabb aabb, void* fn_udata);
```

Parameters | Description
--- | ---
tree | The tree to query.
fn | A callback [CF_AabbTreeQueryFn](/collision/cf_aabbtreequeryfn.md) you have implemented. This is called once per hit. See [CF_AabbTreeQueryFn](/collision/cf_aabbtreequeryfn.md) for more details.
aabb | The [CF_Aabb](/math/cf_aabb.md) to query the tree against. Internally tracked AABBs hit will be reported via `fn`, a callback [CF_AabbTreeQueryFn](/collision/cf_aabbtreequeryfn.md) you must implement.
fn_udata | Can be `NULL`. An optional user data pointer, handed back to you when `fn` is called to report hits.
