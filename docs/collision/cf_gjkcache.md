This struct is only for advanced usage of the [cf_gjk](/collision/cf_gjk.md) function. See comments inside of the [cf_gjk](/collision/cf_gjk.md) function for more details.

## Remarks

Contains cached geometric information to speed up successive calls to [cf_gjk](/collision/cf_gjk.md) where the shapes don't move much relatie to
one other from one call to the next.
