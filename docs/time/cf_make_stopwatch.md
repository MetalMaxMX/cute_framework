# cf_make_stopwatch

Category: [time](/api_reference?id=time)  
GitHub: [cute_time.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework/blob/master/include/cute_time.h)  
---

Records a new `start_time` for a [CF_Stopwatch](/time/cf_stopwatch.md).

```cpp
CF_Stopwatch cf_make_stopwatch();
```

## Return Value

Returns an initialize [CF_Stopwatch](/time/cf_stopwatch.md) to the time of _right now_ (e.g. with [cf_get_ticks](/time/cf_get_ticks.md) internally).

## Remarks

Once created with [cf_make_stopwatch](/time/cf_make_stopwatch.md) the time elapsed can be fetched. To reset the stopwatch, simply call
[cf_make_stopwatch](/time/cf_make_stopwatch.md) again and overwrite your old stopwatch. To fetch the time elapsed, call [cf_stopwatch_seconds](/time/cf_stopwatch_seconds.md),
[cf_stopwatch_milliseconds](/time/cf_stopwatch_milliseconds.md), or `cf_microseconds`.
