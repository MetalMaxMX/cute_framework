A basic haptic for sine-based waveforms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave).

Struct Members | Description
--- | ---
`CF_HapticWaveType wave_type` | The delay between `attack` and `fade` in the envelope (see [CF_HapticEnvelope](/haptic/cf_hapticenvelope.md) for more details).
`int duration_milliseconds` | Time between each wave in milliseconds, or 1.0f/frequency. See [CF_HapticEnvelope](/haptic/cf_hapticenvelope.md) for details.
`int period_milliseconds` | The period of the sin wave. Must be from 0.0f to 1.0f.
`float magnitude` | The strength/amplitude of the sin wave.
`CF_HapticEnvelope envelope` | The envelope for the haptic. See [CF_HapticEnvelope](/haptic/cf_hapticenvelope.md) for details.
