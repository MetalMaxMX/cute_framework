# CF_Haptic

---

An opaque pointer representing a haptic.

## Remarks

Haptics is for rumbling or vibrating devices or controllers.

A haptic pointer can be opened by calling `haptic_open` on a joypad. See cute_joypad.h for info on joypads.

Haptics can be a little complicated -- if you just want a simple rumble effect then the rumble functions might be a good option for you.

TODO - Open haptic on the device itself (e.g. for phones).
